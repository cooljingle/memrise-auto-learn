# Memrise Auto Learn

This userscript allows you mark a word as learned whilst in a learning session, to save yourself having to go through all the (usually mandatory) test screens in order for it to become 'planted'.

### Usage

Once installed, if you are on a test screen in a learning session the script will insert an option to auto learn:

<img alt="screenshot" src="images/autolearn.png" width="70%" />

To auto learn the word:
1. Check the Auto learn option
2. Submit a correct answer

Once done the session will skip future planting stages and the word will be planted and ready for the normal review scheduling.

### Installation

The easiest method is through the Tampermonkey [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) / [firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).
